# üëã Hi there

I'm Talisson Junior (Tj), a passionate software developer and tech enthusiast. I currently work as a Senior Software Developer at Tekeezy. </br>
With over 8 years of experience in the field, I've had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects and explore different technologies.


# üöÄ Expertise

As a multifaceted software developer, my expertise stretches across both frontend and backend development, and extends into the realm of mobile application development. I'm well-versed in numerous languages and tools, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, and Dart, along with .NET Core for backend services. </br>

In the frontend sphere, I utilize renowned frameworks like Angular and Vue.js to construct interactive, user-centric web applications. For the backend, I am skilled in building robust, high-performing solutions using Node.js and .NET Core, adept at ensuring efficient data flow and service functionality.</br>

A considerable portion of my work is dedicated to Flutter, which I employ to create responsive, visually appealing mobile applications that function seamlessly across various platforms. I relish the opportunity to meld my creativity with problem-solving capabilities to produce comprehensive, user-focused solutions.</br>

Additionally, I specialize in creating automation tools and developing VSCode extensions, underscoring my commitment not only to developing superior software solutions, but also to improving development workflows and processes.
